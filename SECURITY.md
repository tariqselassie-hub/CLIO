# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

CLIO is currently in active development. Security updates are applied to the latest version only.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in CLIO, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainer (see GitHub profile)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Do NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (optional but appreciated)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

## Security Model

### Threat Model

CLIO is designed as a personal development assistant with the following assumptions:

1. **Trusted User**: The user running CLIO is trusted
2. **Untrusted AI Outputs**: AI-generated code/commands are treated with caution
3. **Local Execution**: CLIO runs locally on the user's machine
4. **API Keys**: API keys are stored locally and transmitted securely over HTTPS

### Security Features

#### Tool Filtering

CLIO allows restricting which tools are available to the AI agent. This is useful for security hardening, bot deployments, or running CLIO in constrained environments:

```bash
# Only allow file and terminal operations
clio --enable file_operations,terminal_operations --new

# Block web and remote access
clio --disable web_operations,remote_execution --new
```

Persistent configuration:
```
/config set enabled_tools file_operations,terminal_operations
/config set disabled_tools web_operations,remote_execution
```

`--enable` creates an allowlist (only listed tools register). `--disable` creates a blocklist (everything registers except listed tools). CLI flags override config values. No tool is immune from filtering - even `user_collaboration` can be disabled for non-interactive bot mode.

#### Path Authorization

CLIO implements a path authorization system:

- Operations inside the working directory are auto-approved
- Operations outside require explicit user confirmation
- This prevents AI from accidentally modifying system files

#### API Key Storage

- API keys are stored in `~/.config/clio/config.json`
- File permissions should be set to user-only (recommended: `chmod 600`)
- Keys are never logged or displayed in full

#### Session Isolation

- Each session has its own isolated workspace
- Session files stored in `.clio/sessions/` with restricted permissions
- Lock files prevent concurrent session access

#### Secret Redaction

CLIO automatically detects and redacts sensitive information from tool output before it is displayed or transmitted to AI providers. This is handled by `SecretRedactor.pm` with five configurable levels:

| Level | What's Redacted |
|-------|----------------|
| **strict** | Everything - PII, private keys, database passwords, API keys, tokens |
| **standard** | Same as strict (recommended for most use cases) |
| **api_permissive** | PII and cryptographic material only - API keys/tokens pass through |
| **pii** (default) | Only PII - SSN, credit cards, phone numbers, email addresses |
| **off** | No redaction (use with caution) |

Pattern categories detected:
- **PII**: Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, UK National Insurance numbers
- **Cryptographic material**: PEM private keys, database connection strings with passwords (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- **API keys**: AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Google Cloud, OpenAI, Anthropic, Slack, Discord, Twilio, and generic key/secret patterns
- **Tokens**: JWT tokens, Bearer tokens, Basic auth headers

Configure via:
```
/config set redact_level standard
```

#### Input Sanitization

- AI outputs are sanitized to remove potentially dangerous content
- Terminal escape sequences are filtered (safe subset allowed)
- UTF-8 encoding is enforced throughout

### Known Limitations

1. **API Key Encryption**: Keys are stored in plain JSON (not encrypted)
   - Mitigation: Ensure proper file permissions
   - Future: OS keychain integration planned

2. **Network Trust**: HTTPS is used but certificate validation details vary by provider
   - Mitigation: Use trusted API providers only

3. **AI Prompt Injection**: AI could be manipulated by malicious input
   - Mitigation: User confirmation for sensitive operations
   - Mitigation: Path authorization system

4. **Terminal Escape Sequences**: Partial sanitization implemented
   - Mitigation: TerminalGuard module for state cleanup
   - Future: More comprehensive sanitization

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Review AI Suggestions**: Always review code before execution
2. **Protect API Keys**: Don't share config.json; use proper file permissions
3. **Use Incognito Mode**: For sensitive work, use `--incognito` flag
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep CLIO updated to get security fixes
5. **Session Cleanup**: Use `/session trim` to remove old sessions

### Security Testing

We welcome security testing and responsible disclosure. Areas of interest:

- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- API key exposure
- Terminal escape sequence injection
- Prompt injection attacks
- Session file manipulation
