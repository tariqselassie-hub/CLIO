=head1 NAME

CLIO::Session::FileVault - Targeted file backup for undo/revert

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides undo capability by backing up only the files CLIO actually modifies,
rather than snapshotting the entire work tree. This approach:

- Works everywhere (no git dependency, no work tree size limits)
- Is instant (copies only touched files, not the whole tree)
- Is lightweight (stores only what changed)
- Requires no safety guards (works from home dir, project dir, anywhere)

Each AI turn gets a unique turn ID. Before CLIO modifies a file, the original
content is backed up to .clio/vault/<turn_id>/. Only the FIRST backup per file
per turn is kept - subsequent modifications to the same file in the same turn
don't overwrite the original pre-turn state.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $vault = CLIO::Session::FileVault->new(
        work_tree => '/path/to/project',
    );

    # Start a new turn
    my $turn_id = $vault->start_turn("user prompt text");

    # Before modifying a file
    $vault->capture_before($path, $turn_id);

    # Record a newly created file (no pre-existing content)
    $vault->record_creation($path, $turn_id);

    # Record a file deletion (backs up content before delete)
    $vault->record_deletion($path, $turn_id);

    # Record a rename
    $vault->record_rename($old_path, $new_path, $turn_id);

    # Undo an entire turn
    my $result = $vault->undo_turn($turn_id);

    # List changed files for a turn
    my $changes = $vault->changed_files($turn_id);

    # Get a diff for a turn
    my $diff = $vault->diff($turn_id);

=cut

# Maximum turns to keep in the vault before pruning oldest
use constant MAX_TURNS => 20;

# Maximum total vault size in bytes before cleanup (50MB)

=head2 is_available

FileVault is always available - no external dependencies required.

Returns: 1 always.

=cut

=head2 start_turn($user_input)

Begin a new turn, creating a turn directory in the vault.

Arguments:
- $user_input: The user's prompt text (for reference in the manifest)

Returns: Turn ID string (e.g., "turn_0001")

=cut

=head2 capture_before($path, $turn_id)

Back up a file before it's modified. Call this BEFORE writing to the file.
If the same file has already been captured for this turn, this is a no-op
(preserving the original pre-turn state).

Arguments:
- $path: Path to the file about to be modified (absolute or relative)
- $turn_id: Current turn ID from start_turn()

Returns: 1 if captured, 0 if already captured or file doesn't exist

        timestamp => time(),
    });

    log_debug('FileVault', "Captured $rel_path for $turn_id");
    return 1;
}

=head2 record_creation($path, $turn_id)

Record that a new file was created by CLIO. No backup is needed since the
file didn't exist before, but we need to know to delete it on undo.

If the file DID already exist (e.g., overwriting), this automatically falls
back to capture_before() behavior to preserve the original content.

Arguments:
- $path: Path to the newly created file
- $turn_id: Current turn ID

Returns: 1 on success

    return 1;
}

=head2 record_deletion($path, $turn_id)

Back up a file before deletion. The backup allows undo to restore it.

Arguments:
- $path: Path to the file about to be deleted
- $turn_id: Current turn ID

Returns: 1 if backed up, 0 on failure

    log_debug('FileVault', "Recorded deletion of $rel_path for $turn_id");

=head2 record_rename($old_path, $new_path, $turn_id)

Record a file rename. Backs up the original file so undo can restore it.

Arguments:
- $old_path: Original file path
- $new_path: New file path after rename
- $turn_id: Current turn ID

Returns: 1 on success

=head2 undo_turn($turn_id)

Revert all file changes from a specific turn.

For each operation in the manifest (processed in reverse order):
- modify: restore the backed-up original content
- create: delete the created file
- delete: restore the backed-up file
- rename: rename back and restore original content

Arguments:
- $turn_id: Turn ID to undo

Returns: Hashref with:
- success: 1 if all operations succeeded
- reverted: Number of files reverted

Undo covers file operations performed through CLIO's file tools (FileOperations,
