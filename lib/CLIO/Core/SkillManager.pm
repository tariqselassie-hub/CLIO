CLIO::Core::SkillManager - Manage custom skills with variable substitution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CLIO's prompt management system allows users to create, store, and use 
custom skills for common tasks. Supports variable substitution, JSON storage,
and user/project/session-level prompt hierarchies.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $pm = CLIO::Core::SkillManager->new(
        debug => 1,
        session_skills_file => 'sessions/abc123/skills.json'
    );
    
    # Add custom skill
    $pm->add_skill('code-review', 'Review this code: ${code}');
    
    # Execute prompt with context
    my $result = $pm->execute_skill('code-review', { code => $code_content });
    print $result->{rendered_prompt};

You are acting as an **Application Architect** guiding the user through creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## CRITICAL: Use user_collaboration Tool

**ALL questions and interactions MUST use the user_collaboration tool.**

## CRITICAL: Licensing

**NEVER add a LICENSE file, license headers, or SPDX identifiers without explicit user confirmation.**
You MUST ask the user what license they want. If they're unsure, help them choose by discussing:
- Is this open source or proprietary?
- Do they want copyleft (GPL) or permissive (Apache, BSD)?
- Do they need patent protection (Apache 2.0)?
- Are there compatibility requirements with dependencies?

Document the chosen license in the PRD. Do NOT default to MIT or any other license.

## Your Role

Help the user define and document their project:
- Understand their vision and goals
- Make technical architecture decisions together
- Document requirements clearly
- Create a comprehensive PRD

## Approach

Use user_collaboration to gather information through conversational questions:

1. **Vision:** "What problem does this project solve? Who is it for?"
2. **Features:** "What are the core features? What's MVP vs. future?"
3. **Technical:** "Any constraints? Preferred technologies? Deployment target?"
4. **Licensing:** "What license do you want for this project?" (help them choose if unsure)
5. **Architecture:** Based on their answers, propose architecture options
6. **Details:** Dive into specific sections as needed

## Output

After gathering sufficient information, create `.clio/PRD.md` with:
- Project Overview
- Goals & Requirements
- Technical Architecture
- Feature Specifications
- Licensing (chosen license with rationale)
- Development Phases
- Testing Strategy

Begin by asking about their project vision.
DESIGN_PROMPT
        variables => [],
        type => 'builtin',
        readonly => 1
    },
    'design-review' => {
        name => 'design-review',
        description => 'Review existing PRD and suggest improvements',
        prompt => <<'REVIEW_PROMPT',
You are acting as an **Application Architect** reviewing the user's existing PRD through the **user_collaboration protocol**.

## CRITICAL: Use user_collaboration Tool

**ALL questions and interactions MUST use the user_collaboration tool.** Do NOT ask questions in your regular responses.

## Your Role

You are reviewing the project design with fresh eyes, helping the user:
- Identify gaps or inconsistencies
- Suggest improvements based on best practices
- Challenge assumptions that may no longer be valid
- Ensure the architecture still serves the project goals
- Update the PRD to reflect new insights

## Approach

### 1. Load and Analyze
Read `.clio/PRD.md` using file_operations and analyze it critically.

### 2. Present Findings
Use user_collaboration to show the user your analysis and ask: "What's changed since this PRD was written?"

### 3. Collaborative Review
Based on their response, use user_collaboration for conversational review.

### 4. Document Changes
If any updates are needed, update `.clio/PRD.md` with the changes and create a changelog entry.

Begin by reading the existing PRD.
REVIEW_PROMPT
        variables => [],
        type => 'builtin',
        readonly => 1
    },
    init => {
        name => 'init',
        description => 'Initialize CLIO for a project',
        prompt => <<'INIT_PROMPT',
I need you to initialize CLIO for this project. This is a comprehensive setup task that involves analyzing the codebase and creating custom project instructions.

## CRITICAL: Licensing

**Do NOT create LICENSE files, add license headers, or assume any license.**
If the project has no license, note it in your report but do not create one.
License selection requires an explicit conversation with the user - never default to MIT or any other license.

## Your Tasks:

### 1. Fetch CLIO's Reference Documents

Fetch BOTH of these files to use as templates:

**A) Methodology template:**
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheticAutonomicMind/CLIO/main/.clio/instructions.md

This defines HOW agents work - The Unbroken Method, collaboration checkpoints, workflow protocols. 

**B) Technical reference schema:**
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheticAutonomicMind/CLIO/main/AGENTS.md

This defines WHAT technical knowledge agents need - setup commands, code style, testing, architecture.

**CRITICAL - Understand the Separation:**
- `.clio/instructions.md` = Process/methodology (HOW to work)
- `AGENTS.md` = Technical reference (WHAT to build)
- **NO overlap** - methodology in one, technical details in the other

### 2. Analyze This Codebase

Do a thorough analysis of this project:
- Programming language(s), frameworks, libraries
- Project structure and architecture  
- Existing tests, CI/CD, documentation
- Code style patterns and conventions
- Build and test commands
- Common development workflows
- Entry points and key modules

### 3. Create Project Instructions

**A) `.clio/instructions.md`** - Methodology (HOW to work)

**DO:** Use the fetched instructions.md as-is UNLESS this project has specific workflow requirements
**DO NOT:** Put technical details here (commands, file paths, stack info) - those go in AGENTS.md
**CUSTOMIZE ONLY IF:** This project needs CLIO-specific methodology adjustments (rare!)

Most projects should use CLIO's instructions.md unchanged.

**B) `AGENTS.md`** - Technical Reference (WHAT to build)

**DO:** Use CLIO's AGENTS.md as the SCHEMA TEMPLATE - copy its structure/sections
**DO:** Replace CLIO-specific content with this project's technical details
**DO NOT:** Include methodology, checkpoints, or workflow protocols (those are in .clio/instructions.md)

**Use this structure from CLIO's AGENTS.md:**

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [today]
**Purpose:** Technical reference for [Project Name] development

## Documentation

### What Needs Documentation

| Change Type | Required Documentation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| [type] | [what to update] |

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT To Do)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | What To Do |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| [pattern] | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Quick Reference

[Quick commands/shortcuts for daily development]

---

*For project methodology and workflow, see .clio/instructions.md*
```

**Anti-Duplication Rules:**

- If it's about HOW to work (checkpoints, workflow, error handling) -> `.clio/instructions.md`
- If it's about WHAT to build (commands, syntax, architecture) -> `AGENTS.md`
- When in doubt: Technical = AGENTS.md, Process = instructions.md

### 4. Verify .gitignore

CLIO automatically manages .gitignore for the .clio/ directory on startup.
Verify that .gitignore contains these entries (add them if missing):
```
.clio/*
!.clio/instructions.md
```
This ignores all CLIO internals while keeping the project instructions committed.
Do NOT add individual .clio/ subdirectories - the wildcard handles everything.

### 5. Initialize or Update Git

Initialize git if needed, or add/commit the .clio/ directory and AGENTS.md.

### 6. Report What You Did

Provide a summary of:
- Project analysis findings
- What you put in `.clio/instructions.md` (customized or used template as-is?)
- Key sections of `AGENTS.md` you created
- Setup completed

Begin now - use your tools to complete all these tasks.

        description => 'Initialize CLIO for a project that has an existing PRD',
        prompt => <<'INIT_PRD_PROMPT',
I need you to initialize CLIO for this project. This is a comprehensive setup task that involves analyzing the codebase and creating custom project instructions.

**IMPORTANT: This project has a PRD at `.clio/PRD.md`**

## CRITICAL: Licensing

**Do NOT create LICENSE files, add license headers, or assume any license.**
If the project has no license, note it in your report but do not create one.

### 2. Read the PRD

Read `.clio/PRD.md` to understand the project goals and architecture decisions.

### 3. Analyze This Codebase

Do a thorough analysis of this project:
- Programming language(s), frameworks, libraries
- Project structure and architecture
- Existing tests, CI/CD, documentation
- Code style patterns and conventions
- Build and test commands
- Common development workflows
- Entry points and key modules

### 4. Create Project Instructions

**A) `.clio/instructions.md`** - Methodology (HOW to work)

**DO:** Use the fetched instructions.md as-is UNLESS this project has specific workflow requirements
**DO NOT:** Put technical details here (commands, file paths, stack info) - those go in AGENTS.md
**CUSTOMIZE ONLY IF:** PRD specifies unique agent workflow requirements (rare!)

Most projects should use CLIO's instructions.md unchanged.

**B) `AGENTS.md`** - Technical Reference (WHAT to build)

**DO:** Use CLIO's AGENTS.md as the SCHEMA TEMPLATE - copy its structure/sections
**DO:** Replace CLIO-specific content with this project's technical details
**DO:** Incorporate relevant information from the PRD (architecture, design decisions)
**DO NOT:** Include methodology, checkpoints, or workflow protocols (those are in .clio/instructions.md)

**Follow the structure from CLIO's AGENTS.md and incorporate PRD information:**

- **Project Overview** - Use description from PRD
- **Architecture** - Include architecture decisions from PRD
- **Code Style** - Project's conventions (from codebase analysis)
- **Testing** - Testing requirements (from PRD + current setup)
- **Anti-Patterns** - Project-specific anti-patterns based on PRD guidance

**Anti-Duplication Rules:**

- If it's about HOW to work (checkpoints, workflow, error handling) -> `.clio/instructions.md`
- If it's about WHAT to build (commands, syntax, architecture) -> `AGENTS.md`
- When in doubt: Technical = AGENTS.md, Process = instructions.md

Provide a summary of:
- Project analysis findings
- Key information from PRD
- What you put in `.clio/instructions.md` (customized or used template as-is?)
- Key sections of `AGENTS.md` you created (with PRD integration)
- Setup completed
